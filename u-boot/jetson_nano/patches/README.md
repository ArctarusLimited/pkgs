# Jetson Nano u-boot

The patches for the jetson nano u-boot are copied over from the [OpenEmbedded for Tegra project](https://github.com/OE4T/u-boot-tegra)

The OE4T project maintains patches from the NVIDA Tegra u-boot in upstream u-boot. The patches branch can be identified with the `patches-` prefix.

The diff is generated by looking at the commit history for the `patches-` branch and doing a diff between `HEAD` and the upstream u-boot release.

Eg:

For the `v2022.01` release of u-boot we'd be using `patches-v2022.01` branch of the OE4T project.

The diff is generated as:

`git diff d637294e264adfeb29f390dfc393106fd4d41b17 HEAD --no-prefix`

where commit `d637294e264adfeb29f390dfc393106fd4d41b17` is the commit that started of the upstream u-boot [release](https://github.com/OE4T/u-boot-tegra/commit/d637294e264adfeb29f390dfc393106fd4d41b17).
